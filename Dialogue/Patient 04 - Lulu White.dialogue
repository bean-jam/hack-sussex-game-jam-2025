The Madam of Mahogany Hall enters. She does not knock; she nods at Alejandro as if he were a house cat.
Lulu: "Jacques. Business is booming, but the girls are getting caught in the family way. It’s bad for the silhouette and bad for the profits. I need something discreet. No singing and dancing, just results."
Voudou Jacques: "For the Queens of the Night, we use the old ways. I have prepared the alligator’s teeth. Brew them as a tea, strong and bitter. And give them charms of eagle eyeballs to wear around the waist. It turns away the seed."
Lulu: (Slides a heavy coin purse across the table) "You’re a pragmatist, Jacques. I like that."
Voudou Jacques: "I serve the spirits, Lulu. Sometimes the spirits demand life, sometimes they prevent it. Keep the tea locked away."

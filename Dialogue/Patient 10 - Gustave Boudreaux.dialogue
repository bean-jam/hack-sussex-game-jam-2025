Old Gustave shuffles in, twisting his hat. He looks ashamed. He lost his savings to a 'magic bean' salesman in the French Quarter.
Voudou Jacques: "Gustave, you have the good heart, but the soft head. The spirits cannot protect you if you open the door to the wolf. We play a game now. I will be the stranger. You tell me: is this magic, or is this a trick?"
Voudou Jacques (Scenario 1): "I pull a root from my pocket. I say, 'Gustave, this root was grown in the graveyard of a Saint. It costs ten dollars, but it guarantees you find a diamond ring tomorrow.' True or False?"
Gustave: "Well... a Saint's graveyard is powerful..."
Voudou Jacques: "Non! Slap the table. Look at the root. It is a potato dried in the sun! Rule number one: If the promise is too big for the price, the magic is a lie. Try again."
Voudou Jacques (Scenario 2): "I come to your door. I say, 'I see a black cloud over your house. For five dollars, I will burn a candle to check if you are cursed.' True or False?"
Gustave: "That sounds like help?"
Voudou Jacques: "False! That is the 'Fear Trap.' I create the fear, then sell the cure. Rule number two: A true traiteur waits for you to ask for help; he does not peddle fear on the doorstep."
Gustave: "I think I see... so if they rush me, it is a lie?"
Voudou Jacques: "Now you are seeing with the third eye, Gustave."

The hermit looks more skeleton than man today. He shakes, not from fear, but from a deep, hollow weakness. He collapses onto the floorboards.
Jericho: "Jacques... the nets are empty. The river is too high. I haven't eaten in three days. The strength... she is gone. I cannot even paddle home."
Voudou Jacques: (I wave my hand dismissively at the medicine jars.) "You do not need roots today, old friend. You need the fire of life."
Jericho: "I have no coin for fancy cures."
Voudou Jacques: "This cure is on the house. Alejandro, move your tail. I have a pot of Hot Jambalaya on the stove. Andouille sausage, rice, and peppers hot enough to wake the dead, with added rat’s tails, toad’s legs and viper’s venom. Eat, Jericho. The spice will chase the cold from your belly and put the iron back in your blood. Food is the oldest magic there is."

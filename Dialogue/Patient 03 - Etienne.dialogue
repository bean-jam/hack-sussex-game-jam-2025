The musician stumbles in, his hands wrapped in bandages. He is trembling.
Etienne: "Jacques! I can't play the horn! My fingers... they are on fire!" (He unravels the bandages to reveal clusters of angry, weeping boils).
Voudou Jacques: "Saints preserve us. You have touched something foul, Etienne. Have you been playing in the graveyards again?"
Etienne: "I found a silver mouthpiece in a crypt... I thought it would give me the 'ghost note'."
Voudou Jacques: "You stole from the dead to feed your jazz? Foolish boy. This is Grave Rot. Alejandro, bring me the jar of Leeches and the knife."
Etienne: "Leeches? Jacques, no!"
Voudou Jacques: "Hold still. We must draw the bad blood out before the rot reaches your heart. Then, a poultice of viper venom. You will not play the horn for a moon cycle, or your fingers will fall off like ripe fruit."

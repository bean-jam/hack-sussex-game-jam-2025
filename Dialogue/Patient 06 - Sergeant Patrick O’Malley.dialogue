The midday sun is high now, turning the swamp into a steaming cauldron. The air thickens with the buzz of cicadas. Alejandro has moved to the patch of shade beneath your wicker chair, his tail twitching occasionally as the next wave of petitioners arrives.

O’Malley: (Wheezing) "Jacques... I arrested a sailor from Panama... two days ago. Now the fire is in my bones. They call it Bronze John. The doctors... they just want to bleed me. I ain't ready to die, Jacques."
Voudou Jacques: "Do not sit, Sergeant. The Bronze John travels fast. Alejandro, stay back—the fever smells of death."
O’Malley: "My eyes... everything looks yellow. Help me."
Voudou Jacques: "The doctors cut the vein and let the life out. I put the life in. You need the Yellow Fever Cure. I will boil rat’s tails and eagle’s eyeballs. You must drink it until the sweat runs clear and the demon leaves your blood. It will taste like swamp mud, but it will keep you on this side of the dirt."

The faded aristocrat sits heavily. She is not crying, but she stares blankly at the wall, her posture slumped in defeat.
Marie-Claire: "I cannot get out of bed, Jacques. The sun rises, and I wish it hadn't. My chest feels heavy, like a stone is sitting on my lungs. The plantation is gone, the parties are gone... why should I remain?"
Voudou Jacques: "You are suffering from the gray sickness. The spirit is willing to quit, even if the body is strong."
Marie-Claire: "Is there a poison? To make it end?"
Voudou Jacques: "No poison here, Madame. Only life. You need the Cure for Melancholy. I will brew ayahuasca. It brings the light back into the mind. It will not buy back your plantation, but it will give you the strength to stand up and face the world again. The sun will shine warm on you tomorrow."

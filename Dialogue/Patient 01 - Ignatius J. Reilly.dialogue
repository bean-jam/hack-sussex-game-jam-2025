A large, lumbering man in a tweed cap drags himself up the rope ladder. He is sweating profusely and clutching a stained handkerchief.
Ignatius: (Bellowing) "My valve! My pyloric valve is reacting violently to the humidity of this primitive bog! I demand audience with the mystic. I am beset by employers who lack geometry and theology in their souls!"
Voudou Jacques: "Sit, mon ami. The spirits do not care for your valve, they care for your path. You seek to know why the world rejects you?"
Ignatius: "It is a conspiracy of dunces, I tell you! I cannot hold a clerkship for a week without being assaulted by their incompetence. Cast your runes. Tell me when Fortune shall spin her wheel in my favor."
Voudou Jacques throws a handful of knucklebones onto the table. They clatter and settle in a chaotic heap.
Voudou Jacques: "The bones say the wheel is not stuck, Cher. You are the one holding the brake. You look for a crown, but the spirits see only a jester's cap until you learn silence. Go. Bathe in ayahuasca to cool that valve of yours."

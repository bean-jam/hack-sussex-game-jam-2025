The gambler is twitchy. He keeps looking over his shoulder. He isn't sick, but he looks terrified.
Silas: "It’s bad, Jacques. I won a pot off 'One-Eyed' Pierre, and he swore a hex on me. Since then? I walked under a ladder, broke a mirror, and lost my lucky pocket watch. I feel the bad luck clinging to me like wet wool."
Voudou Jacques: "You have attracted the 'crossed' spirits, Silas. You are walking naked in a storm."
Silas: "I need protection. Something I can carry. Something heavy."
Voudou Jacques: "I will craft you a Grigri. A red flannel bag. Inside, I put toad’s legs for agility, Alligator Teeth to bite back at your enemies, and a silver coin to pay the toll. Wear it next to your skin, over your heart. Do not let Pierre touch it, or the magic breaks."
